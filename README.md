# Data_Structures and Algorithms

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a core concept in computer science used to organize data efficiently and solve problems effectively.

Data Structures help store and manage data

Example 

    arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs.

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures to solve problems

Example 
     
     sorting, searching.

Why DSA is Important?

Improves problem-solving skills

Helps write optimized and efficient code

Essential for coding interviews and competitive programming



# Fibonacci Sequence in Python 🐍

This project demonstrates different ways to generate the Fibonacci sequence in Python.

The Fibonacci sequence:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
```

Each number is the sum of the two previous numbers.

## Methods Implemented

### 1️⃣ Using Loop (List)

* Builds the sequence using a `for` loop.
* **Time:** O(n)
* **Space:** O(n)

---

### 2️⃣ Using Recursion

* Uses formula: `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`
* **Time:** O(2ⁿ) (slow for large n)
* **Space:** O(n)

---

### 3️⃣ Using Dynamic Programming (Memoization)

* Stores previously calculated values.
* **Time:** O(n)
* **Space:** O(n)

---

### 4️⃣ Iterative (Constant Space) ✅

* Uses two variables instead of a list.
* **Time:** O(n)
* **Space:** O(1)
* **Most efficient method**

## 🚀 Problems & Solutions

### 1. Stock Whisperer (Array Analysis)
**Problem:** Find the maximum profit possible by buying a stock on one day and selling it on a future day.
* **Logic:** Instead of nested loops, we use a **Single Pass** approach. We track the `min_price` seen so far and calculate the potential profit at every step.
* **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$
* **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

### 2. Anagram Grouper (Hash Maps)
**Problem:** Group a list of strings into sub-lists where each sub-list contains words that are anagrams of each other.
* **Logic:** Uses a `dictionary` (Hash Map) where the **sorted version** of the word acts as the key (e.g., "eat" and "tea" both become "aet").
* **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k \log k)$ (where $k$ is the length of the longest word).
* **Space Complexity:** $O(n \cdot k)$



### 3. The Missing Link (Mathematical Logic)
**Problem:** Given an array containing $n$ distinct numbers in the range $[0, n]$, find the one number that is missing.
* **Logic:** Uses **Gauss's Summation Formula**. By calculating what the sum *should* be and subtracting the *actual* sum, the remainder is our missing value.
* **Formula:** $$\sum_{i=0}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$
* **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$
* **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

## 📊 Customer Behavior Analytics (OOP)
**Goal:** Transform raw transaction logs into actionable business intelligence using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.

### Key Features:
* **Data Ingestion:** Parses string-based dates and amounts into Python `datetime` objects.
* **RFM Logic:** Implements a custom scoring algorithm to rank customers based on loyalty and spending.
* **Churn Detection:** Automatically flags customers as "At Risk" if their recency exceeds 30 days.

### Technical Highlights:
* **OOP Design:** Encapsulates logic within a `RetailAnalytics` class for reusability.
* **Sorting & Lambda:** Uses complex sorting to rank data by calculated scores.
* **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$ for data ingestion and $O(M \log M)$ for reporting (where $M$ is the number of unique customers).




### ⚡ Concise Quick Sort (Functional Approach)
A compact implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm using Python's list comprehensions and recursion.

**The Logic:**
1. **Base Case:** If the list is empty, return `[]`.
2. **Pivot:** The first element (`a[0]`) is chosen as the pivot.
3. **Partition:** - `left`: Elements $\le$ pivot.
   - `right`: Elements $>$ pivot.
4. **Combine:** Recursively sort both sides and join them with the pivot in the middle.



**Analytical Trade-off:**
While this version is extremely readable and short, it uses $O(n)$ extra space per recursion level due to list creation. For large-scale data, an **in-place** version is preferred to optimize memory.
