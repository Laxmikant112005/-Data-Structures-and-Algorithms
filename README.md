# Data_Structures and Algorithms

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a core concept in computer science used to organize data efficiently and solve problems effectively.

Data Structures help store and manage data

Example arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs.

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures to solve problems

Example sorting, searching.

Why DSA is Important?

Improves problem-solving skills

Helps write optimized and efficient code

Essential for coding interviews and competitive programming

Fibonacci Sequence in Python 🐍

This project demonstrates different ways to generate the Fibonacci sequence in Python.

The Fibonacci sequence:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

Each number is the sum of the two previous numbers.

Methods Implemented

1️⃣ Using Loop (List)

Builds the sequence using a for loop.
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)

2️⃣ Using Recursion

Uses formula: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
Time: O(2ⁿ) (slow for large n)
Space: O(n)

3️⃣ Using Dynamic Programming (Memoization)

Stores previously calculated values.
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)

4️⃣ Iterative (Constant Space) ✅

Uses two variables instead of a list.
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
Most efficient method Happy Coding 🚀
